NaiveBayes.java

----------------------PROGRAM DESCRIPTION-----------------------

Given a set of preproccesed training and test data, this program 
uses Naive Bayes classifiers to classify document into (classes 
provided in map.csv) different classes. 

Two classifiers are used in this program: Maximum Likelihood
Estimator and Bayesian Estimator.

This program learns the Naive Bayes classifiers first with the
training data. Then it will evaluate the accuracy of both
classifiers with provided training and testing data.

Program returns the results such as: class priors, overall
accuracy, class accuracy, and confusion matrix based on the
evaluation made.

DEBUGGING flag is initially set to FALSE.


----------------------------HOW TO-------------------------------

The program should be compiled in terminal(have to be in correct
directory first) with the line below:

	javac NaiveBayes.java


Then run it by calling: 

	java -cp <directory> NaiveBayes.NaiveBayes


where <directory> should look something like /Users/Downloads/
and all input files (vocabulary, map, train_data, train_label,
test_data, test_label) should be in the same folder as 
NaiveBayes.java
